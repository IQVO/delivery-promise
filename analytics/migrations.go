// Package analytics holds the ANALYTICAL database's schema (ADR 0018): the
// golang-migrate files under migrations/, embedded so cmd/dp-projector applies
// them without a migrations directory in the image (the same approach as the
// OLTP migrations in internal/adapters/outbound/postgres). The analytical
// database is separate from the OLTP one; it is written only by
// cmd/dp-projector and read (read-only) by cmd/dp-reports.
